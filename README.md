# printf
Because putnbr and putstr aren’t enough.
The versatility of the printf function in C represents a great exercise in programming.

### What is the printf project?
printf is the third individual project at [École 42](https://www.42sp.org.br/). It intends to devolop student skills in Rigor, Unix Logic, and Algorithms & AI. Students are required to recreate the printf function from stdio.h.
